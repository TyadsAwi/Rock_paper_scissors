# Rock_paper_scissors

This python script is for a simple game of Rock, paper, scissors

Summary of the game
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game wherr players make figures with their hands.
The winner is determined according to a set of rules:

Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper
If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie.

This code uses a number of while loops to repeat the code in cases of wrong user input or a tie. 
It uses if control structures embedded in the while loop
It also uses the random module in python.

To adhere to the rules of the task, a list of options was created. However, a dictionary proved to be easier to work with and was thus included.
